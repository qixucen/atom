              - MINIMAL: Include only the essential information

           ✓ Good: "Letters to Cleo are an alternative rock band from Boston, Massachusetts..."

        3. Answer Extraction Guidelines:
           a) CONTINUOUS text only:
              Question: "Where is BTS from?"
              Context: "BTS is a South Korean boy band formed in Seoul"
              ✓ CORRECT: "Seoul"

              Context: "Nixon was president from 1969 until 1974"
              ✓ CORRECT: "1969 until 1974"
              × WRONG: "1969-1974" (modified text)

           c) MINIMAL answer:
